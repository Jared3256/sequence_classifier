# Sequence Classifier 🧬

This project implements a machine learning model to classify DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction. 🖥️

Check out [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@asharahmed.py/building-a-sequence-classifier-with-machine-learning-and-a-slick-gui-8418e0f2e97e) for more details on the implementation.

## Overview 

The sequence classifier follows these main steps:

1. Read sequence data from FASTA files 📄
2. Extract features from sequences using one-hot encoding 🔢  
3. Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the sequence features 💪
4. Build a GUI with Tkinter to allow user sequence input and classification 🖥️

## Usage

To use the sequence classifier:

1. Clone this GitHub repository 👯
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 📥
3. Run `python sequence_classifier.py` ⚡️
4. Input sequences via the GUI and hit "Classify" 👆

The output will display the predicted class (positive/negative), predicted probability, and detected sequence type (DNA, RNA, or protein). 📊

Some sample sequences are provided to test the classifier. ✅

## Implementation Details

- `read_fasta.py` - Module to parse FASTA files and extract sequences 🗂️
- `feature_extraction.py` - One-hot encoding of sequences 🔀
- `model_training.py` - Functions to train SVM model 🏋️
- `gui.py` - Tkinter GUI implementation 🖌️
- `sequence_classifier.py` - Main driver script 🚗

The trained SVM model and sample training data are provided in the `models/` and `data/` directories respectively. 🗄️
